# GradRent

**GradRent** is a modern, user-friendly web application designed for college students to easily find, list, and rent flats/PG accommodations near their campuses. Built as a startup MVP (Minimum Viable Product), it focuses on seamless navigation between colleges (e.g., ABESEC, AKGEC, ABESIT), secure authentication, and quick flat listings. Whether you're a student searching for affordable housing or a landlord listing properties, GradRent simplifies the process with a clean, responsive interface.

This project is actively developed and open to contributions. Join us in building the go-to rental platform for the grad community!

## üõ† Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **React.js** (v18.x): Core framework for building dynamic UIs.
- **React Router**: Client-side routing for pages like Home, AddFlat, ListWithUs, and Login.
- **CSS Modules**: Custom styling with responsive breakpoints (mobile, tablet, desktop).
- **Context API**: State management for user data, authentication, and app-wide state.

### Backend & Services
- **Firebase**: Authentication, real-time database (for flat listings), and hosting.
- **No-Code Backend**: Leverages Firebase for quick MVP scaling without a full server.

### Tools & Deployment
- **Development**: Vite/Webpack for bundling, ESLint for code quality.
- **Deployment**: Firebase Hosting (or Vercel/Netlify for easy CI/CD).
- **Version Control**: Git/GitHub.

## üìã Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+ recommended)
- npm or yarn package manager
- Firebase account (for auth and database setup)
- Git

## üèó Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/GradRent.git
   cd GradRent
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # Or if using yarn: yarn install
   ```

3. **Set Up Firebase**:
   - Create a Firebase project at [console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com).
   - Enable Authentication (Email/Password) and Firestore Database.
   - Download your `firebase-config.js` (or create one) and place it in `src/`:
     ```js
     // src/firebase.js (example structure)
     import { initializeApp } from 'firebase/app';
     import { getAuth } from 'firebase/auth';
     import { getFirestore } from 'firebase/firestore';

     const firebaseConfig = {
       // Your config: apiKey, authDomain, projectId, etc.
     };

     const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
     export const auth = getAuth(app);
     export const db = getFirestore(app);
     ```
   - Install Firebase SDK if not already: `npm install firebase`.

4. **Environment Variables** (Optional for Production):
   - Create a `.env` file in the root:
     ```
     REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
     REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
     # Add other Firebase config vars
     ```

5. **Run Locally**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   # App runs on http://localhost:3000
   ```

## üöÄ Usage

1. **Start the App**: After installation, run `npm start`. The app opens in your browser.
2. **Test Authentication**: Navigate to the login page and sign in/out using Firebase.
3. **Add a Flat**: Go to `/AddFlat`, fill the form, and submit (data saves to Firestore).
4. **Browse Listings**: Use the college dropdown on the header to filter and view flats on `/ListWithUs`.
5. **Mobile Testing**: Resize your browser or use dev tools to test the hamburger menu and responsive layout.

### Example Workflow
- Student: Select college ‚Üí Search flats ‚Üí Contact landlord (future feature).
- Landlord: Sign in ‚Üí Add flat ‚Üí List it for the selected college.

For production deployment:
- Build: `npm run build`
- Deploy to Firebase: `firebase deploy` (after `firebase init`).
